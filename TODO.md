* Strings aren't taking "" as initializers, or rather "" (& probably '' by extension) aren't working in general.
And also this isn't working...
> String index = " "
> index += 5 + " - "

* Allow # in single and double quotes to work b/c currently it segfaults.

* Unmatched "end" / Else lacks a friend issue with recurssion.

* Confirm x=y and x = y both work

* Add bitwise logical operators

* Fix and= or= xor= operators

* Add boolean operator symbols instead of just words
* Add not operator

* Fix lists
